perl587delta - what is new for perl v5.8.7

=head1 DESCRIPCIÓN

This document describes differences between the 5.8.6 release and
the 5.8.7 release.

=head1 Cambios incompatibles

There are no changes incompatible with 5.8.6.

=head1 Mejoras en los componentes

=head2 Unicode Character Database 4.1.0

The copy of the Unicode Character Database included in Perl 5.8 has
been updated to 4.1.0 from 4.0.1. See
L<http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.1.0/#NotableChanges> for the
notable changes.

=head2 suidperl menos inseguro

A pair of exploits in C<suidperl> involving debugging code have been closed.

For new projects the core perl team strongly recommends that you use
dedicated, single purpose security tools such as C<sudo> in preference to
C<suidperl>.

=head2 Optional site customization script

The perl interpreter can be built to allow the use of a site customization
script. By default this is not enabled, to be consistent with previous perl
releases. To use this, add C<-Dusesitecustomize> to the command line flags
when running the C<Configure> script. See also L<perlrun/-f>.

=head2 C<Config.pm> is now much smaller.

C<Config.pm> is now about 3K rather than 32K, with the infrequently used
code and C<%Config> values loaded on demand. This is transparent to the
programmer, but means that most code will save parsing and loading 29K of
script (for example, code that uses C<File::Find>).

=head1 Cambios en utilidades

=head2 find2perl enhancements

C<find2perl> has new options C<-iname>, C<-path> and C<-ipath>.

=head1 Mejoras en el rendimiento

The internal pointer mapping hash used during ithreads cloning now uses an
arena for memory allocation. In tests this reduced ithreads cloning time by
about 10%.

=head1 Mejoras en la instalación y configuración

=over 4

=item *

The Win32 "dmake" makefile.mk has been updated to make it compatible
with the latest versions of dmake.

=item *

C<PERL_MALLOC>, C<DEBUG_MSTATS>, C<PERL_HASH_SEED_EXPLICIT> and C<NO_HASH_SEED>
should now work in Win32 makefiles.

=back

=head1 Arreglo de determinados errores

=over 4

=item *

The socket() function on Win32 has been fixed so that it is able to use
transport providers which specify a protocol of 0 (meaning any protocol
is allowed) once more.  (This was broken in 5.8.6, and typically caused
the use of ICMP sockets to fail.)

=item *

Another obscure bug involving C<substr> and UTF-8 caused by bad internal
offset caching has been identified and fixed.

=item *

A bug involving the loading of UTF-8 tables by the regexp engine has been
fixed - code such as C<"\x{100}" =~ /[[:print:]]/> will no longer give
corrupt results.

=item *

Case conversion operations such as C<uc> on a long Unicode string could
exhaust memory. Esto ha sido corregido.

=item *

C<index>/C<rindex> were buggy for some combinations of Unicode and
non-Unicode data. Esto ha sido corregido.

=item *

C<read> (and presumably C<sysread>) would expose the UTF-8 internals when
reading from a byte oriented file handle into a UTF-8 scalar. Esto ha sido corregido.

=item *

Several C<pack>/C<unpack> bug fixes:

=over 4

=item *

Checksums with C<b> or C<B> formats were broken.

=item *

C<unpack> checksums could overflow with the C<C> format.

=item *

C<U0> and C<C0> are now scoped to C<()> C<pack> sub-templates.

=item *

Counted length prefixes now don't change C<C0>/C<U0> mode.

=item *

C<pack> C<Z0> used to destroy the preceding character.

=item *

C<P>/C<p> C<pack> formats used to only recognise literal C<undef> 

=back

=item *

Using closures with ithreads could cause perl to crash. This was due to
failure to correctly lock internal OP structures, and has been fixed.

=item *

The return value of C<close> now correctly reflects any file errors that
occur while flushing the handle's data, instead of just giving failure if
the actual underlying file close operation failed.

=item *

C<not() || 1> used to segfault. C<not()> now behaves like C<not(0)>, which was
the pre 5.6.0 behaviour.

=item *

C<h2ph> has various enhancements to cope with constructs in header files that
used to result in incorrect or invalid output.

=back

=head1 Diagnósticos nuevos y cambiados

There is a new taint error, "%ENV is aliased to %s". This error is thrown
when taint checks are enabled and when C<*ENV> has been aliased, so that
C<%ENV> has no env-magic anymore and hence the environment cannot be verified
as taint-free.

The internals of C<pack> and C<unpack> have been updated. All legitimate
templates should work as before, but there may be some changes in the error
reported for complex failure cases. Any behaviour changes for non-error cases
are bugs, and should be reported.

=head1 Cambios internos

Se ha hecho una buena cantidad de refactorizaciones del código fuente C<C>, en parte para que sea más ordenado y más fácil de mantener. The resulting object code and the
C<perl> binary may well be smaller than 5.8.6, and hopefully faster in some
cases, but apart from this there should be no user-detectable changes.

C<${^UTF8LOCALE}> has been added to give perl space access to C<PL_utf8locale>.

The size of the arenas used to allocate SV heads and most SV bodies can now
be changed at compile time. The old size was 1008 bytes, the new default size
is 4080 bytes.

=head1 Problemas conocidos

Unicode strings returned from overloaded operators can be buggy. This is a
long standing bug reported since 5.8.6 was released, but we do not yet have
a suitable fix for it.

=head1 Problemas en plataformas específicas

On UNICOS, lib/Math/BigInt/t/bigintc.t hangs burning CPU.
ext/B/t/bytecode.t and ext/Socket/t/socketpair.t both fail tests.
These are unlikely to be resolved, as our valiant UNICOS porter's last
Cray is being decommissioned.

=head1 Notificación de errores

Si usted encuentra algo que piensa que es un error, podría verificar los artículos publicados recientemente en el grupo de noticias comp.lang.perl.misc y la base de datos de errores de perl en http://bugs.perl.org/.  También puede haber información en http://www.perl.org/, la página oficial de Perl.

Si usted cree que tiene un error no declarado, por favor, ejecute el programa B<perlbug> incluido en su distribución.  Asegúrese de reducir la aparición del error en un programa que sea pequeño, pero suficiente.  Su informe de error, junto con la salida de C<perl -V>, serán enviados a perlbug@perl.org para ser analizado por el equipo de adaptación de Perl.  Puede navegar y buscar en el web de los errores de Perl 5 en http://bugs.perl.org/
